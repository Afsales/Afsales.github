# Hello there !!
Welcome to Ava's website ðŸ˜„

In here, you see a game I play everyday ðŸ˜‰ (it keeps me straight)
### ANYWAY

## Explanation ðŸŒ 
What is Genshin? Is Genshin fun? 

Looks like I have to answer the questions now, huh?

### Firstly, the story starts with twins fighting an Unknown God. You get to pick between Lumine (left) and Aether (right)

I don't really remember how the start would go, but I do know that since you're new to the game, the game tutors you.

### And in the start, you meet Paimon!! The best travel companion ever!! Paimon goes with your adventures in Teyvat.

### For now there are three nations naming Mondstadt (anemo), Liyue (geo), and Inazuma (electro). This year, a new nation "Sumeru" will be open ðŸ˜„
This is becoming a tutorial on how to play the game ðŸ˜“

### There is also a wish system !!
Wish is where you can gain 5star, 4star characters and 5star, 4star, 3 star weapons.

Every version has a limited banner dedicated for a 5star character and 3 4star characters. You need 90 rolls for you to get a 5star character. 
But aside from that, you need to win the 50/50. Hehe
